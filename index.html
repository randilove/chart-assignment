        <p>The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway cantilever has been sandwiched between a neighborhood and the waterfront with new businesses and residences popping up around it since 1954. With population growth and increased building density came community concerns and the need for regular maintenance of the bridge and expressway.</p>

        <p>Montero’s Bar and Grill has sat on Atlantic Avenue off of Hicks Street since 1948 when the city demolished the original location across the street to build the expressway . The second-generation owner, Pepe Montero, said he hasn’t been directly affected by the construction and proposed changes, but on- and off-ramp bottlenecking has been a nuisance for years. </p>

        <p>“There’s a ton of traffic out there everyday blowing their horns,” he said. “They’re trying to switch from one lane and the other cars are trying to change. This is Atlantic Ave. There’s an entrance to the BQE and an exit. It’s a double whammy.”</p>

        <p>He chose not to put tables and chairs outside because of the corner where his bar sits.</p>

        <p>“It’s too dangerous. Everyday there’s a fender bender out there,” Montero said. “Cars that are driving on Hicks Street, once they hit Atlantic Avenue they realize ‘Oh I’m in the wrong lane. I need to be in the right-hand lane, I’m in the left-hand lane.’ They try to switch over and that’s when fender benders happen.”</p>

        <p>Montero said he won’t do anything outdoors because of the constant accidents and danger to his patrons. He says the changes being made to the expressway cantilever do not directly affect him, but traffic backs up on the main street and the side street which makes it unsafe to serve his patrons if they aren’t inside his establishment.</p>

        <p>In September 2021, there were 13 accidents on the expressway at the Atlantic entrance/exit alone, according to the Motor Vehicle Collision Report Brooklyn Highways, Bridges, Tunnels released by the New York Police Department. Of the 24 people involved in the incidents, four were injured. Only one collision occurred eastbound on Atlantic Avenue, the dozen others happened on the westbound side of the expressway .</p>

        <p>Mayor de Blasio and New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Hank Gutman’s release of a comprehensive plan to extend the life of the cantilever by 20 years.</p>

        <p>The press release explains the ways in which they plan to revitalize the future of transportation dependence on large diesel trucks in a four-part breakdown. Their idea is to preserve the cantilever, execute immediate and ongoing maintenance, expand monitoring and enforcement, and develop a long-term, community-based vision for the entire corridor.</p>
    
        <p>Milstein Professor of Urban Development at Columbia GSAPP and expert panelist Kate Ascher said nobody knows exactly what will come next even with the plan that has been laid out.</p>
            
        <p>“I think you can only hope that with the federal money that maybe there's an opportunity to really do something significant here,” she said.</p>

        <p>Brooklyn Community Board 2 Chairperson Lenue Singletary said consumers rely on the expressway to provide transit between Manhattan and the outer boroughs, and the issue has outgrown the ability for one agency to resolve.</p>

        <p>“This isn’t a problem that happened overnight,” Chairperson Singletary said. “This is an issue that has been known for years and has deteriorated over time so much so that now it is a real problem.”</p>

        <p>Ascher said the panel’s mission wasn’t to come up with a plan, it was created to point out what needed to be done to improve the deteriorating structure and issues in the surrounding areas. She said they set the table for others to use available funding to look at the issues with the expressway in a more serious way.</p>
            
        <p>“I think the findings were that there should be a real proper study done and this highway should be rebuilt, not just the tri level structure,” Ascher said.</p>

        <p>Tesh Parrish, assistant account executive at Grimaldi’s Pizzeria in Brooklyn-Heights, said the business owners were unavailable to comment . Representatives from the Brooklyn Cat Cafe  and Brooklyn Heights Winebar & Kitchen said their businesses were unaffected completely.</p>

        <p>Joe’s Coffee Company, New Xcell Auto Repair, the Harvest Home Farmer’s Market, Odd Fellows and Table 87 did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
